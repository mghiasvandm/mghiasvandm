- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mghiasvandm
- ğŸ‘€ I am passionate about AI and NLP research and am fortunate to be working under the supervision of two professors at AUT, despite being only a second-year distinguished undergraduate student. My programming journey began five years ago, and after gaining experience as a full-stack web developer, I am eager to delve into research on topics related to large language models tasks.
