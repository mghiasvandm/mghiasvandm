🎓 Hello! I am a B.S. Student at the Amirkabir University of Technology.<br>

🔭 My very initial research project was about Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) which I've been able to publish a state-of-the-art (SOTA) paper to Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL) journal and the project was completed I was only a 3rd-semester bachelor student which is undone before in the world. 
But Currenlty, my primary research focus lies in the Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs).
