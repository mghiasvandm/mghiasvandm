- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mghiasvandm
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in AI & NLP Research and have the priviledge to work under supervision of two professors @ AUT despite being a 2nd year distinguished undergraduate student. My programming journey has been started from 5 years ago and after being a full stack web developer, I'm enthusiast to research about the topics related to large language models tasks.
