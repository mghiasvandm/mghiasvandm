#### Info about me...
Hello! I am a M.S. Student at the Language & Knowledge Lab at KAIST, advised by Minjoon Seo.<br>
<br>
My primary research focus lies in the intersection of natural language generation (NLG) and establishing a science of language model behaviors.<br> Concretely, my research interests include: (i) developing fine-grained evaluation frameworks that systematically identify what specific capabilities language models lack and (ii) exploring the role of synthetic data to induce desired abilities into language models for further improvement.<br>
<br>
Reach out to me via email (seungone@kaist.ac.kr) if you have any questions, or would like to collaborate with me!<br>
